    "description": "This plugin replaces a standard multi-select with a simplified version that doesn't require ctrl+click to select multiple options. Each click simply toggles the given option on or off. The original multi-select is hidden, and a replacement is built. The original multi-select is updated on each click so that when when your form is submitted, you get what you expected.",
